      A simple add-on to generate form data from OpenAI's GPT model.
      </p>
      <p>
      FormsGPT works by calling OpenAI's GPT model and interpreting the results to transform the structure of your Google Forms. 
      By using OpenAI's GPT model, we generate data to be interpreted within Google Forms from User's text input. 
      That being said, we would require special credentials provided from the User to operate correctly. 
      We DO NOT save any credentials you send to FormsGPT, we only use it for one-time calls to OpenAI's GPT API and you need to re-enter the credentials for new sessions. Use at your own risk.
